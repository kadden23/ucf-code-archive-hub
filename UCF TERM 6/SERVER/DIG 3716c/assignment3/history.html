				A Strong Decade -<br /><br />
				AN EVEN STRONGER YEAR<br /><br /><br />

				UCF recently celebrated its research accomplishments at a fitting 
                location&mdash;the Stadium Club at UCF's Bright House Networks Stadium. 
                And there's a lot to celebrate.

                After a decade of consistent funding increases, UCF researchers 
                received a record $133.3 million from outside sponsors in 2010&mdash;
                an increase of nine percent from FY 2009. Even more impressive, 
                researchers were awarded a cumulative $1.05 billion in funding since FY 2000.
            <br />
            <br />
                "While we talk every year about the significance of research funding
                 on the local and state economy, it became dramatically apparent this 
                 year, when we crossed the billion dollar mark in funding during an 
                 11-year period, that we really had something to celebrate," said M.J. 
                 Soileau, UCF's vice president for Research and Commercialization.

                At the event, the football-themed music (including the "Zombie Nation" 
                soundtrack made popular at UCF Knights football games), appearances by 
                UCF Athletics Director Keith Tribble and Knightro (the UCF mascot), and 
                the listing of the funding on the scoreboard got more than 200 attendees 
                excited about the milestones the university has reached throughout the 
                last 11 years. Following another long-standing tradition, everyone was 
                given a bottle of "MJ's Special Blend" hot sauce in appreciation of their efforts.
