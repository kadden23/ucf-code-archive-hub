	<p>
	<strong>The Rules:</strong>
	<p>
	<ol>
	<li>The name of the game is <em>Petals Around the Rose</em></li>
	<li>The name of the game is significant.</li>
	<li>The answer is always zero or an even integer.</li>
	<li>Once you have figured out the pattern, you are sworn to secrecy and you MAY NOT tell anyone the pattern</li>
	<li>If you violate the above rule, you will turn into a turtle.</li>
	</ol>
	</p><p>
	<strong>The Procedure:</strong>
	<ol>
	<li>I will roll the dice and, and tell you how many Petals there are.</li>
	<li>I will do this as many times as you ask me to, by saying "Roll".</li>
	<li>You form a hypothesis. Write it down, in Formalized Hypothesis terms.</li>
	<li>To test your hypothesis, say "Test". I will roll the dice but NOT tell you the number.</li>
	<li>You then tell us the number that is predicted by your hypothesis, and I say "Right" or "Wrong".</li>
	<li>Remember the Rules. When your group has confirmed your hypothesis, KEEP IT TO YOURSELVES.</li>
	</ol>
