                In 2010, the Office of Research and commercialization at 
                UCF celebrated a major accomplishment - UCF researchers accrued 
                $1.05 billion in research-related funding since 2000.
                <br />
                <br />
                
                In those 11 years, our researchers increased funding, were 
                ranked four times on national top 10 lists for the strength of 
                our patents, and built-with the help of our community partners-a 
                nationally recognized entrepreneurship ecosystem that has resulted 
                in more than 1,600 jobs and a $200 million annual economic impact.  
                UCF has also celebrated 11 classes of millionaires, researchers who
                have attracted $1 million or more in funding in a fiscal year.  
                UCF's millionaires have collectively received $507 million in 
                funding since 2000.
                <br /><br />
                
                We achieved these milestones by aligning our key areas of research 
                with our region's and our state's economy. Over the years, we have 
                developed some of the nation's strongest concentrations in lasers and 
                options, simulation and training, computer science, alternative energy, 
                biomedical science, nanoscience and materials, among other areas.
                <br /><br />
                
                A significant part of the growth is due to efforts to commercialize 
                the research conducted at UCF.  Our associate vice president for research 
                and founder of the UCF Business Incubation Program, Dr. Tom O'Neal, is 
                largely responsible for these efforts that lead to the formation of Central 
                Florida companies and jobs, as well as national recognition for the strength 
                of our research.
                <br /><br />
                
                UCF generated a 268 percent increase in annual funding since 2000 and a 
                record $133.3 million in funding in 2010 from outside sponsors.  Last year
                also produced the largest-ever class of millionaires, 41 researchers, and 
                a record $75.8 million in federal funding.
                <br /><br />
                
                The Florida Solar Energy Center received the highest funding of all UCF units 
                with $21.2 million, largely as a result of a $10 million program geared toward 
                equipping schools with energy-efficient roofs and the administration of a separate
                training program for using solar energy in southern states.  The College of 
                Engineering and Computer Science received the second-highest funding amount at 
                UCF with $16.7 million and the Institute for Simulation and Training followed 
                with $15.3 million.
                <br /><br />
                
                In 2005, when UCF first crossed the $100 million mark for research funding, we 
                started what has become a tradition - rewarding our winning research team with bottles 
                of "MJ's Special Blend" hot sauce.  IT's a tradition that appeals to my Cajun upbringing 
                but also speaks to UCF's red hot research potential.  If you haven't tasted it, stop 
                by my office and grab a bottle.  And for the decade ahead: Laissez les bon temps roulez!
