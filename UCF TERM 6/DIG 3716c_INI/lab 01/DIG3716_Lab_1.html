	<h3>DIG3716c Spring 2011</h3>
	<h1>XHTML</h1>

	<p>Markup the information on this sheet of instructions as an XHTML 
	document according to the criteria listed below:</p>

	<p>- Include everything on this sheet in your XHTML document. Yes, that 
	 means this line should be there too. And this one! And everything that 
	 appears before and after this line. All of the header stuff at the top 
	 too. Really. Maybe try using an &lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt; element for the
	  “XHTML Lab” text.
	</p>

	<p>Oops – what you should find is that when you tried to write 
	 &lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt; in 
	the sentence above, the browser didn’t understand that you wanted to 
	literally write those symbols instead of rendering an XHTML element 
	to the screen. A simple way to write the symbols for an XHTML element 
	without rendering the element is to replace the angled brackets &lt;&gt; 
	with their entity character equivalents. The entity character for &lt; is 
	&amp;lt; and the entity character for > is &amp;gt; (the lt stands for 
	 less than and the gt stands for greater than, which is what those 
	 symbols usually mean when you write them!)
	</p>

	<p>- Don’t worry about the presentation of content – just recreate the 
	   structure of this document with valid XHTML
	</p>

	<p>- This XHTML document should be titled Last Name – Lab 1 XHTML, 
	 replacing “Last Name” with your real last name. No need to fake 
	 it, I have a class roster.
	</p>

	<p>- Indent nested elements to visually represent the parent/child 
		hierarchy between all of the elements in the XHTML document.
	</p>
	
	<p>- Link to a few web tools you can’t live without. For reference, I’ve 
	linked a few of mine. These links will have to be absolute paths 
	because they exist on the WWW, not on the server this page will 
	exist on.
	</p>

	<p>Include a relative link to a picture of yourself. If you don’t have a 
	picture of yourself, include a picture of a cat. People on the Internet 
	always get a kick out of that.

	<p>
	The path to the root folder containing all of your labs and 
	assignments in this class should be 
		<strong>/home/students/nid/public_html/dig3716c</strong>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	This lab assignment should be in a sub-directory of your root folder 
	called lab1_xhtml, like this: 
		<br />
		<strong>
		/home/students/nid/public_html/dig3716c/lab1_xhtml
		</strong>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Any images in this lab assignment should be located in a sub-directory
	of your lab folder called “images”, like this:
		<br />
		<strong>
		/home/students/nid/public_html/dig3716c/lab1_xhtml/images
		</strong>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Here’s a hint – use the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; element 
	<strong>
	add importance to content.
	</strong>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Your document should validate as XHTML Strict 1.0 at the 
		<a href="http://validator.w3.org" >
		http://validator.w3.org
		</a> 
		page. Test it out there when you’re done marking up the page!
	</p>
	
	<p>
	If you can put a checkmark next to each of these requirements then 
	you’re done! These requirements are similar to the way your assignment 
	specifications will be written up, so make sure you understand them.
	</p>
