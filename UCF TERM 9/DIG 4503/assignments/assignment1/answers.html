q1*Lua is a powerful, fast, lightweight, embeddable scripting language.*q1*Lua combines simple procedural syntax with powerful data description constructs based on associative arrays and extensible semantics. Lua is dynamically typed, runs by interpreting bytecode for a register-based virtual machine, and has automatic memory management with incremental garbage collection, making it ideal for configuration, scripting, and rapid prototyping.*q2*Lua is a proven, robust language and is currently the leading scripting language in games.*q2*Lua is fast- Several benchmarks show Lua as the fastest language in the realm of interpreted scripting languages. Lua is fast not only in fine-tuned benchmark programs, but in real life too. A substantial fraction of large applications have been written in Lua.*q2*Lua is portasble- It runs on all flavors of Unix and Windows, and also on mobile devices (such as handheld computers and cell phones that use BREW, Symbian, Pocket PC, etc.) and embedded microprocessors (such as ARM and Rabbit).*q2*Lua is small- The tarball for Lua 5.2.0, which contains source code and documentation, takes 241K compressed and 950K uncompressed. The source contains around 20000 lines of C. Under Linux, the Lua interpreter built with all standard Lua libraries takes 182K and the Lua library takes 240K.*q3*It's free! Lua is open-source software, distributed under a very liberal license (the well-known MIT license). It may be used for any purpose, including commercial purposes, at absolutely no cost. Just download it and use it.*q4*Lua is designed, implemented, and maintained by a team at PUC-Rio, the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. Lua was born and raised in Tecgraf, the Computer Graphics Technology Group of PUC-Rio, and is now housed at Lablua. Both Tecgraf and Lablua are laboratories of the Department of Computer Science of PUC-Rio.*q5*"Lua" (pronounced LOO-ah) means "Moon" in Portuguese. As such, it is neither an acronym nor an abbreviation, but a noun. More specifically, "Lua" is a name, the name of the Earth's moon and the name of the language. Like most names, it should be written in lower case with an initial capital, that is, "Lua".*q6*If you want to help you can support Lua by making a donation <a href="http://www.lua.org/donations.html#donation">here</a>*q6*You can also help to spread the word about Lua by buying Lua products at <a href="http://www.zazzle.com/Lua_Store">Zazzle</a> and <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/lualang">CafePress</a>.
