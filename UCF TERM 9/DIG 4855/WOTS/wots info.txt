Our Title:
Harnessing UCF's Kinetic Potential: Creating a Smarter Grid One Step At A Time


Project Objective:

The intention of this research is to discover alternative energy sources 
(to help supplement campus energy consumption.) that help improve 
efficiency of electrical usage on campus.  Our research is focused on 
the kinetic power of a simple human footstep in combination with 
piezoelectric technology, energy storage, and social media environments. 



Our Abstract:

As energy consumption increases, so too does the need for sustainable 
energy sources. We believe that a human’s movement can be an excellent 
source of energy that can be harvested seamlessly from a native environment.
Utilizing piezoelectric technology, kinetic movement, and social media 
integration, we are able to generate energy from a simple footstep. One 
example of this technology is a piezoelectric surface, that when force is 
applied to it, generates an electric charge that can be stored . This method
 will be the most unobtrusive for gathering energy from human movement. Our 
intention is to track and influence the collective energy output of the UCF 
community using a social media component. Though one footstep may seem like 
a small amount of energy produced, the best results are from a mass 
contribution in a small community. So, what better place is there than UCF? 
Imagine a smart grid system that collects the kinetic energy from footsteps 
in high traffic areas across campus. Utilizing a social media component, users' 
collective output data can be shared and compared individually. This research, 
will in further detail, explore how it is possible to increase energy output 
on a proposed smart grid system through social media participation.
