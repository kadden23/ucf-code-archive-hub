	<h3>Kyle Cartechine - Group/Project Leader</h3>
	<p>
		I consider myself the main contributor of ideas for the group. Iv'e come up with 
		ideas for logos and branding, the website layout, different possible foot pad
		prototypes, and ideas for social media components in the website. I also put together the
		preliminary and critical design documents as well as our midterm presentation. Then the rest
		of the group made any edits or changes they thought were necessary. I also created the initial 
		titles and abstract for the SURE event which everyone helped edit and solidify.
	</p>
	<p>
		I will say I have done little research for the group; Bryce and Greg have been excellent
		at researching and finding usefull information related to our topic. However, now that we
		have decided to scrap the DDR pad idea, I'm researching how I might be able to deconstruct
		a computer keyboard and use it for a foot pad prototype with some hopefully open source 
		software. I am working on finalizing the Walking On The Sun website; meaning I'll
		be combining Daniel and Greg's different initial site designs into one cohesive one.
		Of course everyone will have their parts coding some of the back end and providing and creating 
		art assets for the site.
