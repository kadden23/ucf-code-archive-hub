            <p>
            	As enrollment continues to increase at the University of Central Florida, it is 
            imperative to continue to provide academic support services and programs that can 
            lead to academic success, persistence, and graduation. Providing academic support 
            services for a diverse student population in an effective and efficient way can 
            only be accomplished through collaboration. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
            	The Student Academic Resource Center (SARC) relocated to the Student Success Center 
            in 113 Phillips Hall in mid December 2000. The SARC staff continues to look forward
            to providing programs and services that help students achieve academic success.Some 
            of these services include individual and group tutoring assistance, Supplemental 
            Instruction, Peer Assisted Learning on-line (PALs), College Level Academic Skills 
            Test (CLAST) advising and assistance, advising for the College Achievement Program 
            and Pegasus Success Program students, and academic learning skills workshops. The 
            SARC will continue to provide extended office hours and 24-hour service during the 
            mid term and final exams period.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            	For the 1999-2000 academic year over 10,181 students visited the SARC. Tutoring 
            services were provided to 4,447 students (the SARC is currently seeking National 
            Certification of its tutoring program). The SARC supported 6 web-based courses 
            through the PALs program and the staff provided advising appointments to 1,793 
            students. The SARC was open 24 hours for 8 weeks (mid-term/finals) during the 
            fall and spring terms.

            	Relocation to the Student Success Center provides a centralized location on campus 
            to better meet the needs of UCF’s growing student population. The Student Success 
            Center will also facilitate a stronger collaboration between departments to better 
            address and resolve student issues and concerns. The SARC staff looks forward to 
            working with faculty and staff to help better deliver services to UCF students.
