            <p>
            A student becomes a part of the College Achievement Program (CAP) when the 
            State Board of Education (SBE) requires him/her to enroll in college preparatory 
            coursework. The Undergraduate Admissions Office identifies these students by 
            their test scores from the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) or the American College 
            Test (ACT). The Student Academic Resource Center (SARC) becomes the students’ 
            advising office and assists CAP students in achieving their goal of meeting the 
            state requirements. The university works in conjunction with Valencia Community 
            College who provides the preparatory classes and instructors on campus.

            SARC has a professional learning skills advisor who shows students the refinements
            in learning skills needed for learning at the college level. Because learning 
            skills are not usually taught in pre-college education, many students enter UCF 
            with a mismatch between their current study skills and the demands of college level 
            coursework. Through one-to-one advising, workshops, and classroom presentations 
            the learning skills advisor provides information on the refinements and modifications 
            needed to perform well on college level studies.

            <h6>Who Should Take the College Level Academic Skills Test (CLAST)?</h6>
            
            <p>The CLAST is an achievement test that measures students’ attainment of the 
            college-level communication and mathematics skills. The CLAST consists of four subtests:
            </p>  
            
            <ol>
            <li>Essay</li>
            <li>Reading</li> 
            <li>English language</li>
            <li>Mathematics </li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>All students seeking an Associate of Arts or Baccalaureate degree from UCF 
            are required by the State of Florida to satisfy the CLAST requirement. Students 
            are eligible to take the CLAST after the completion of 18 semester hours of 
            credit. Some students may meet the CLAST alternative criteria which is a means 
            to satisfy the CLAST requirement. The alternative looks at SAT/ACT scores or grade 
            point average in composition and math courses. 
            </p>
            
            <p>Students with 60 or more credit hours who have not taken the CLAST may be 
            restricted from future registration. Students who have taken the CLAST but have 
            not satisfied all 4 subtests of the CLAST may enroll for an additional 36 
            semester hours of upper-division credit.  If the CLAST requirement has not been 
            satisfied after these 36 hours have been earned, enrollment in future terms at 
            UCF is prohibited until the CLAST requirement has been met. Any appeals to continue 
            enrollment must be approved by the CLAST Petition Committee.
            </p>
            
            <p> The SARC has several resources available for preparation for the CLAST. 
            There is free math tutoring, math and reading review workshops, computer tutorials, 
            and study manuals.  The SARC also has advisors that can meet with CLAST-liable 
            students to explain the CLAST policies, check to see if students meet the CLAST 
            alternative criteria, and connect students to the appropriate resources. Since the 
            beginning of the year, the SARC has received over 1089 calls in regards to the CLAST
            and has advised 798 students in the area of CLAST. 
            </p>
            
            <p>As admissions standards rise, UCF is forced to deny an increasing number of students. 
            The SARC’s Pegasus Success program is a summer bridge program that admits underprepared 
            freshmen students on a conditional basis, pending the outcome of a six credit hours 
            summer program. The program bridges the transition from high school to college, teaches 
            the difference between high school and college expectations, articulates academic policies 
            and requirements, and connects students to the university resources and support services.
            </p>
            
            <p>Students are identified as candidates for the program based on standardized test 
            scores and grade point averages slightly below the UCF cutoff.  The program is offered 
            in the six-week, summer B term, prior to the fall semester. The students must complete 
            two pre-selected college level courses with a grade C or better in each course. In 
            addition, they attend weekly individual advising sessions, Learning Enhancement 
            Workshops, College Success Workshops and tutoring sessions. Once the students have 
            successfully completed the program, they are admitted to the university in the fall 
            semester and SARC continues to advise and guide them through their freshman year. 
            </p>
            
            <p>The results demonstrate that high school grades and test scores are not the only 
            predictors of college success. In the six years since Pegasus was first implemented, over 
            90% of the number of students enrolled have successfully gained regular admission to the University.
            </p>
            
            <p>During the summer 2000, 153 students started the Pegasus Student Success Program and 
            89% of these students successfully completed the program. One hundred thirty one 
            students returned fall semester and SARC individually advised 96% of those students this Fall semester. 
            </p>
            
            <p>Research on the Pegasus Success program suggests that this program really works. 
            For example, Pegasus students have higher persistence rates to graduation and earn 
            about the same or higher gpa’s by the end of the freshmen year. This data is notable 
            when considering that Pegasus students enter UCF with lower incoming SAT scores. 
            In this light, one does not expect UCF Pegasus students to earn the same or higher 
            gpa’s than freshmen with higher SAT scores. But they do.
