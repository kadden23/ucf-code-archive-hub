          <h6>THE SUPPLEMENTAL INSTRUCTION (SI) EFFECT </h6>
          
          <p>Too many students enter college with high SAT scores and high school GPA’s 
          but still lack the thinking and study skills to accurately portray their intelligence. 
          UCF is fortunate to have SI which is one of 2 retention programs certified by the U. S. 
          Department of Education as an Exemplary Educational Program. This means that SI was 
          proven to actually increase grades and retention. 
          </p>
          
          <p>UCF has had an SI program since 1996 when there were 2 classes with SI support. 
          This past fall semester 2000, 24 sections of classes in biology, chemistry, economics, 
          microbiology, math, and physics had SI support.
          </p>
          
          <p>The SI program model is based on the learning theories of Piaget, Dewey, and Bruner. 
          As a result, students who participate in the SI program enjoy the benefits of collaboration, 
          peer cooperation and support, study skills in notetaking, textbook reading, concentration, memory,
          test preparation, testtaking, time management, etc. In this manner, students acquire and refine 
          the skills for learning and move toward the SI goal of creating independent learners. 
          </p>
          
          <p>SI focuses on historically difficult or high-risk courses and not on high-risk students. 
          A student is hired who has had this course before and has earned an “A” in it. After extensive 
          training, this student, called an SI leader, attends class, takes notes, reads all assignments, 
          and does the homework. The SI leader holds 3-4 SI sessions per week where they focus on 
          communicating the latest in effective study skills for learning the material in the high-risk class. 
          Students cooperate to build complete and accurate lecture notes, complete and accurate solutions 
          to problems, formulate potential exams questions and answers, tackle sample tests, and exchange 
          information on effective learning skills. At appropriate times, SI leaders distribute “how-to” 
          handouts on college level learning skills that are effective for understanding and learning 
          difficult material. Below are some examples of final grade:

          <h6>What Does Retention Mean?</h6>
          
          <p>Some of the research presented may be startling in terms of what is found to work 
          to increase retention but one theme is ever-present: the fewer faculty and staff who 
          participate in retention efforts, the worse is retention. That includes simple 
          activities that range from simple greetings and friendliness toward students to the 
          large programs proven to increase student success and persistence. 
          </p>
          
          <p>According to 23 years of research from the Noel-Levitz Retention Research Group
           (with over 600 on-campus consultations and 97 National Retention Excellence Award 
           winning programs) retention is not a goal!  Noel­Levitz’s two most significant 
           discoveries in the past 10 years of research appear to be contrary to many notions 
           of what reduces attrition: 
          </p>
          
          <ol>
          		<li>"The dropout-proneness of entering students is more a function of attitude and motivation than academic credentials.” </li>
                <li>“…..there is a big difference between academic preparedness and being ready to persist and succeed academically.” </li>
          </ol>
          
          <h6>Common Retention Myths</h6>
          
          <ol>
          		<li>Increasing retention means lowering standards.</li>
                <li>Retention  improves  without  changing organizational behavior.</li>
                <li>Students  bring  an  understanding  of  what  it takes to succeed in college.</li>
                <li>Only  academic  preparedness  equates  to persistence to graduation in college. </li>
                <li>Finances, work, and/or family are the sole reasons students drop out.</li>
         </ol>
         <p>USA Group Noel-Levitz</p> 
         
         <p>It has been traditional to view attrition as the outcome of poor academic 
         preparation skills. Discovery #1 suggests while academic preparedness is 
         essential, it may also be productive to look at services and programs that address 
         the role of motivation and attitudes in the educational experience. Discovery #2 
         emphasizes that it is to revise traditional views of academic preparedness and 
         examine internal factors affecting retention beyond application.
