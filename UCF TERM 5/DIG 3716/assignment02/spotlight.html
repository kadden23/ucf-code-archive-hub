            SARC is the place when students need a tutor. The great thing about this 
            is that many UCF students have already figured this out. Fall 2000 turned out
            to be a banner semester for the SARC’s tutoring program. There was tutorial 
            assistance in nearly 40 content areas including accounting, chemistry, physics
            and statistics. A total of 21 tutors tutored over 2900 students!

            <p>
            Dedication, talent and training combine to make the SARC’s tutors 
            extraordinary people. Tutors must have an overall GPA of 3.0, must have 
            a “B” or better in the course(s) they are tutoring, and must attend monthly 
            on-going training sessions. The fall 2000 tutoring staff included: Leo Anglero, 
            LiLiana Bailey, Anne Sophie Berthaud, Natalie Dopson, Charles Favreau, Kent Lamers,
            Katie Longway, Dean Moniz, Jennifer Montgomery, Michael Minardi, Brandy Parker,
            Shea Phillips, David Radziercz, Yuya Tanahashi, and Audra Willsey. Coleen Hassell
            and Sheree Strampach are the tutor coaches who assist with training and evaluation.

            <h6>Interactive Study Sessions for Athletes (ISS)</h6>
            
            <p>
             Student athletes face tremendous pressures such as workout schedules, practice
             times, games, traveling, AND going to class. To provide support for student athletes
             as they strive to be successful in the classroom, the SARC has partnered with the
             Office of Academic Support for Student Athletes (ASSA) to facilitate Interactive
             Study Sessions (ISS). Unlike other universities that send their athletes to study
             tables (where they sit for extended periods of time with no help or direction), 
             UCF provides an opportunity for small groups of athletes to interact with tutors 
             in a structured setting. Tutors help athletes refine study skills essential skills 
             for learning and exam preparation. Subject areas include: CLAST, sociology, psychology, 
             and physical science. ISS tutors also must meet minimum GPA requirements and have 
             excellent communication skills. The tutors for fall semester: Leo Anglero, Darrin 
             Crovitz, Charles Favreau, Rod Gordon,
             </p>
             
             <h6>SARC Student Advisory Council</h6>
             
             <p>
             This year marks the inception of new goal. The SARC Student Advisory Council is 
             now a reality. The group first met in September and began creating the important role
             they will fill at the SARC. The functions of the group are to: provide student feedback
             about programs, serve as SARC ambassadors at University functions, and provide a link
             to the community through community outreach projects. This year’s members are: Gena 
             Alusio, Jeff Draude, Mileidy Guerrero, Alex Nottingham, Bradley Reed, Nishla Sobers, 
             Yuya Tanahashi, and Audra Willsey.

             A national survey looked at elements required for student satisfaction with their 
             institution of choice in higher education. The National Center for Retention examined 
             the expectations of students as “consumers who have a choice about whether or not to 
             invest in education at a particular institution as well as having definite expectations 
             about what they want from their college experience.” When these expectations were met 
             or exceeded, students were satisfied and much more likely to re-enroll in subsequent 
             semesters. More in the next issue on what are these expectations.

             When faculty and administrators show they care, students who want to be cared 
             about attend that institution. When faculty and administrators show they don’t 
             care, students who don’t want to be cared about attend that institution. How many 
             students do not want faculty and administrators to show they care about them? 
             These elements in faculty/student interaction increase retention and are directly 
             related to the affective (as opposed to cognitive) domain of student development.  
             Since unmet affective needs compose the top 3 reasons why students leave an institution, 
             a faculty member that demonstrates caring will have an enormous effect on retention 
             when they incorporate these ideas below into interaction with students.

                 <li>Learn the name of each student as quickly as possible and use it in class. It creates a safer, friendlier atmosphere in the classroom: 
                    <li>a. Call on students by their first names.</li>
                    <li>b. But be flexible and call on students using whatever address they prefer: first or nickname, Mr., Mrs., Ms….……</li>
                 </li>
                 <li>Tell students how you prefer to be addressed (Prof., Dr., Mr., Mrs., Ms, 1st name, nick name).</li>
                 <li>Before class begins, walk around and personally introduce yourself to individual students. Ask them their major, do they have any questions, etc.</li>
                 <li>In addition to returning tests, quizzes, themes in class, sometimes ask students to stop 
                    by your office to pick them up. This is an opportunity to talk informally.
                 </li>
                 <li>Clearly lay out standards for grading on the 1st day of class and in the syllabus.</li>
                 <li>Be open-minded with exam questions. Students may not interpret words the same as a
                    faulty member. Be understanding and flexible.
                 </li>
             </ol>
