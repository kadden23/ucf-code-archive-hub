    <h3>Hot Rods: A Brief History Lesson</h3>
    <p>You may wonder where the term 'hot rod' actually comes from. Most auto enthusiast and hot rodders will agree it came about when
    people started souping up and racing their cars in the 1930s. Racers would call their rides "hot roadsters" which evolved into what 
    is now called the hot rod. The original hot rods were old Ford Model - Ts, As, or Bs with various types of body and engine modifications
    to reduce weight and increase speed. After World War II hot rodders used many small military airports that were either abandoned or 
    very rarely used to race on marked courses. Drag racing started from these mile or longer airstips that included up to four lanes of 
    racing at the same time. Hot rodding magazines and associations came about with the rise of hot rodding popularity in the '50s.</p>
    
    <h3>Hot Rods: Nowadays</h3>
    <p>Today we have the muscle car, the classic hot rod, and the modern street rod.</p>
