BIOLOGY UNDERGRADUATE NEWSLETTER
Newsletter 1 23 August 2010
__________________________________ ________________________________
Hello,
This is the first in what I plan to be a number of regularly occurring emailnewsletters.
I intend for these newsletters to be monthly. They will contain
announcements, job and research postings, scholarship and financial aid opportunities,
and other information that should help you over the course of the semester.
First of all, I wish to welcome you back to UCF, or to UCF for the first time, for
the Fall 2010 semester. I hope that you had a nice break and are ready to meet the
challenges ahead. We have a number of interesting classes for you this term including
some rarely offered classes (ex; Animal Behavior). This should be a good semester and I
wish you well in it.
Sincerely,

A Welcome to New Biiollogy Majjorrs
Welcome to the University of Central Florida and to the Department of Biology.
This is an exciting time with many challenges and opportunities awaiting you. We hope
that you make the most of your experience here. The Department of Biology wishes to
help you towards that end. Please take the time during your first few weeks at UCF to
stop by the Biology Office (Biology Building room 301). At the Biology Office you can
request to have a Biology faculty member assigned to you as your advisor. Although you
have many excellent sources of advising available to you, you should also make use of an
advisor in your major. Only someone in Biology knows the best balance of courses to
take and which courses to take towards achieving your goals with a B.S. in Biology.
Whether your goals are to attend professional school (e.g. medicine, veterinary, dental,
etc.), attend graduate school, or to immediately enter the workforce we wish to help you.
Please feel free to contact the department with your questions and concerns.
Good luck with your first semester at UCF. We hope that it is a productive and
rewarding experience for you.
Sincerely,

Introduction
The Wildlife Care Department of the Ellie Schiller Homosassa Springs Wildlife
State Park offers internships to students who are currently enrolled in biologyrelated
undergraduate and graduate programs at accredited colleges and
universities. Although most of our interns work here during the summer, our
program is open all year to qualifying applicants.
Benefits
No pay is earned during the internship experience in our Department, and
transportation, room, and board are the responsibility of the intern. However, we
have two bedrooms inside our Felburn Wildlife Care Center that are available on
a first-come, first served basis to successfully placed interns. The bedrooms share
4
a full bath, and a kitchenette with microwave oven and refrigerator are available
24-hours a day to interns living in the Center.
Time Commitment
Although the position of intern is a specialized volunteer placement, for the
internship to be validated, we require a time commitment of 30 hours per week
for at least 6 weeks. Additional hours can be accommodated, up to a 40-hour
work week. The weekly schedule will vary depending on the duties assigned.
Summer Session: May-August
Fall Session: September-December
Spring Session: January-April
Duties
Your service at the Park will include care of wildlife and their enclosures,
maintenance and housekeeping inside the Center, and presentation of educational
programs. Interns work with ALL of the Park's wildlife; there are no positions
available to work exclusively with manatees.
You may pursue a specific research project along with your duties. Your proposal
must be submitted in writing for approval by the Wildlife Care Supervisor. This
proposal must include an introduction describing your goals and objectives,
materials and methods, and an estimate of the amount of time required to
complete the project.
What follows is a basic outline of the job responsibilities of an intern at the Ellie
Schiller Homosassa Springs Wildlife State Park. They are based on the job
description of a Wildlife Care Ranger; however, some requirements have been
eliminated to realistically accommodate the abilities of a temporary intern. Your
specific job description may be altered depending on the instructions of the
Wildlife Care Supervisor.

Biology Faculty
The Department of Biology is fortunate to have many excellent faculty dedicated
to teaching our undergraduate students. In the future I intend to profile one faculty
member per newsletter. For this first newsletter, and since a number of you are new to
UCF, I am will simply direct you to the UCF Biology Faculty and Instructor webpages.
For professors go to: http://biology.cos.ucf.edu/faculty_index.php and for instructors go
to: http://biology.cos.ucf.edu/faculty_instructors.php. (I am not responsible for the ages
of some of these photos.)
1) Faculty Departures and Arrivals
(a) Unfortunately this summer one of our faculty, Dr. Kevin Woo, chose to leave
UCF. In the short time that he was with us, he became an important member of
our department and he will be missed.
(b) We have been fortunate to add two new faculty members. They are Dr. Gregg
Klowden and Dr. Mary Beth Manjerovic. Many of you will have one or both of
them in your classes. Dr. Klowden is team teaching Biology 2 and Ecology. Dr.
Manjerovic is teaching a section of Biology 1 and Animal Behavior. Some of you
may already know Dr. Manjerovic. She was a graduate student in our department
who received her Ph.D. this summer.

Prehealth Professional Students
Can I Go To Medical School With a Degree in Biology?
Yes!
Prehealth Professional students (often referred to as “preprofessional
students”) are students who are preparing to enter into a health professional program after
graduating from UCF. There are a variety of professional health programs that these
students plan to attend, and to matriculate from, so as to succeed in their dreams of
serving in the professional health field. These programs include: Allopathic Medicine,
Chiropractic Medicine, Dentistry, Veterinary Medicine, Optometry, Osteopathic
Medicine, Pharmacy, Physician Assistant, and Podiatric Medicine.
There are many pathways that a prehealth professional student may take to succeed
at UCF. Regardless of what some believe, there is no one major that ensures a student’s
success at this endeavor. In fact any major with the appropriate courses may allow a
student to achieve his/her goal. However, due to academic strength, science majors tend
to prepare prehealth professional more effectively. Prehealth professional programs tend
to prefer students who have shown that they have the potential to handle the rigorous
demands of their programs by having been exposed to a science-based curriculum. At
UCF we have a number of undergraduate programs that can serve to prepare a
preprofessional health student for the next step in his/her education. These programs
include: Biology, Chemistry, Molecular Biology & Microbiology, Psychology, and
Interdisciplinary Studies.
The Department of Biology has a Biology-Preprofessional concentration that is
well designed to assist a student in gaining admission to and succeeding in a professional
health program. The program has a number of core courses that will prepare a student for
the required standardized entrance examinations and will give the student a firm
foundation for the scientific requirements of the health professional program. These core
courses include: Biology 1 (BSC 2010), Biology 2 (BSC 2011), Chemistry 1 (CHM
2045), Chemistry 2 (CHM 2046), Organic Chemistry 1 (CHM 2210), Organic Chemistry
2 (CHM 2211), Genetics (PCB 3063), Physics 1 (PHY 2048 or PHY 2053), Physics 2
(PHY 2049 or PHY 2054), and Molecular Cell Biology (PCB 3023). In addition, the
Biology-Preprofessional concentration allows for studying in a number of upper division
restricted electives that are extremely beneficial to the serious prehealth professional
student. Upper division restricted electives such as: Biochemistry (BCH 4053), Genetics
2 (PCB 4514), Comparative Vertebrate Anatomy (ZOO 3713c), Embryology (ZOO
4603c), and General Microbiology (MCB 3020c); give the student an extensive
knowledge base to get him/her off to a very good start in any health professional
9
program.
In addition, the graduation requirements of the Biology-Preprofessional
concentration give the student a degree of academic flexibility. UCF requires a minimum
of 48 credit hours of 3,000 and above level courses for graduation. The basic
requirements of the Biology major require a minimum of 35 hours of 3,000 and above
level courses. That leaves a 13 credit hour discrepancy that a student can use in any way
that he/she feels will best prepare him/her to succeed in a health professional program. It
typically is most beneficial if the student works closely with his/her academic advisor to
choose these courses.
The Department of Biology has a number of faculty serving as academic advisors
who are well versed in the requirements of a health professional program and the
requirements for acceptance into such programs. These advisors have many years of
experience advising preprofessional health students and assisting them in reaching their
goals.
The Department of Biology has a number of other resources that will also assist the
prehealth professional student to prepare for a professional health program and to
separate himself/herself from other applicants. These resources include: internships,
independent studies, and research opportunities. All of these resources demonstrate
scholarly interest and academic initiative of the nature favored by professional health
program admittance committees.
The prehealth professional concentration of the Biology undergraduate program
possesses many resources and opportunities that will benefit the prehealth professional
student. The concentration in particular, and the degree program in general, will serve
the serious student well in achieving his/her goal of entering into, and succeeding in, a
professional health program.
1) Prehealth Professional Advisement
(a) Office of Pre-Professional Advising (OPPA): The website can be found at
http://www.oppa.ucf.edu/. They will be adding information to the website on a
regular basis throughout the year so please check it often. They are located in:
Ferrell Commons, Building 7G,Room 215C
Tel.: 407-823-3033
Fax: 407-823-0175
Email: oppa@mail.ucf.edu
They will meet with students mostly by appointment, but also on a walk-in basis
when available.
They are also available through facebook at:
http://www.facebook.com/pages/OPPA-at-UCF/168620655705?ref=ts
10
(b) Pre-Health Professional Advisement Office (PPAO): The website can be found at
http://www.biomed.ucf.edu/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=50&
Itemid=77. They are located in:
HPA 1, Room 124
Tel: 407-823-2670
Fax: 407-823-6051
Email: galopez@mail.ucf.edu
syantz@mail.ucf.edu
They will meet with students typically on a walk-in basis but will set up
appointments if requested.
2) Preveterinary Shadowing Opportunity:
Arrangements have been made with University Animal Hospital (9357 University
Blvd, Orlando - (407) 657-7297) to allow UCF students to shadow with the veterinarians.
Any student who is interested should meet with Frank Logiudice (BL 301c). Shadowing
will occur in the mornings of mondays, thursdays, and fridays (when they typically
conduct surgeries). UAH only wants one student per day. That way we can accommodate
3 students per week. Students will be rotated through for 4 shadowing days (4 weeks). At
the end of the month 3 new students will be brought in. This way up to 12 students can
shadow per term (based on interest level). Thank you to UAH for giving our students
this wonderful opportunity!
3) Prehealth Professional Organizations
There are a number of prehealth professional organizations on campus. These are
student clubs that are dedicated to helping student to prepare for, and to apply into, a
career in the health professions. They are a great way to learn what challenges await
you and to prepare for them. Club events include visits to health professional
programs, visits with faculty and students at professional schools, shadowing
opportunities, and charity events. You should explore these clubs. Typically the first
week in September is when they have their first meetings for the fall semester. Some
of the clubs are:
(a) Premedical-AMSA for students interested in medical school:
http://www.premedamsa.com/
(b) Predental-ASDA for students interested in dentistry: http://pdasda.com/
(c) UCF-Preveterinary Club for students interested in veterinary medicine:
http://pegasus.cc.ucf.edu/~prevet/PreVetSite/The_University_of_Central_Florida.html
(d) Pre-Professional Medical Society for students interested in a variety of health
fields: http://ppmedsociety.org.

Science Information on the Web
There are a number of useful websites that you may use to keep yourself up to
date on developments in Biology. You should take the time to periodically check on a
few of them. For one reason, this is an area of your own interest. You will usually find a
story that interests you or helps you with a topic in one of your classes. For another
reason, schools/programs that you will be applying to in the future often expect this and
you may have some related questions in your interviews. I will list three sites for you:
1) http://www.sciencedaily.com/. This is a very good site. It updates with a new story
every few hours on weekdays. It is slower on weekends but still, in my opinion, the
best of the three.
2) http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/index.html. This site usually updates once a
day (around 4:00 pm) on weekdays and not on weekends.
3) http://news.excite.com/index/id/science|ap.html. This is a good site but it updates
sporadically.
Seminars
Seminars are a weekly departmental event where current topics in biology are
discussed. UCF faculty and visiting faculty present a paper at the seminar and answer
questions. It is a good way to learn some information about your field (s) of interest in
biology. Seminar is a graduate level class. However, it is open to interested
undergraduate students (as long as seating allows). The topic and speaker are posted
throughout the Biology Building prior to the event. Seminars are held in BL 209 on
Mondays at 3:00.
